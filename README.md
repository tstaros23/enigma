Self Assessment:

I really struggled during this project with the project structure but was able to get it done. The project uses a lot of class methods. The class methods are required where they are needed so that each class only needs to know what it needs to create the method it is trying to achieve. The code can encrypt and decrypt the messages and has test 100% coverage. Overall, I felt the project went well. In hindsight, I wish I had a better understanding of class interaction by using class methods and seeing the big picture of how everything would be passed through in the end.
